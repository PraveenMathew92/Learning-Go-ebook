## Stack


### https://www.miek.nl/go/#stack

1. Create a simple stack which can hold a fixed number of ints. It does not have to grow beyond this limit. Define push – put something on the stack – and pop – retrieve something from the stack – functions. The stack should be a LIFO (last in, first out) stack.

2. Write a String method which converts the stack to a string representation. The stack in the figure could be represented as: [0:m] [1:l] [2:k] .
